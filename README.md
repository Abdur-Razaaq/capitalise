# capitalise

This code defines a function that alternates the case of alphabetic characters in a string, converting them to uppercase and lowercase in sequence. Non-alphabetic characters (like numbers and special symbols) are left unchanged. It processes each character in the string, and the result is a new string with the desired formatting.
